This is the source code for the 2nd-shortest Project. The project is written in C
and uses the GNU Make build system. Here is a list of the source files:

main.c - The driver program.

graph.h - The header file for the main algorithms and data structures.

graph.c - The implementation of functions in the header.

Makefile - The GNU Make build system file. It contains the rules for
           building the project.

testdata/ - The directory containing test data.

In order to build the project, simply run the following command in UNIX systems:
