  abstract = { We give algorithms for finding the k shortest paths (not required to be simple) connecting a pair of vertices in a digraph. Our algorithms output an implicit representation of these paths in a digraph with n vertices and m edges, in time O(m + n log n + k). We can also find the k shortest paths from a given source s to each vertex in the graph, in total time O(m + n log n + kn). We describe applications to dynamic programming problems including the knapsack problem, sequence alignment, maximum inscribed polygons, and genealogical relationship discovery. }

 abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for finding the K loopless paths that have the shortest lengths from one node to another node in a network. The significance of the new algorithm is that its computational upper bound increases only linearly with the value of K. Consequently, in general, the new algorithm is extremely efficient as compared with the algorithms proposed by Bock, Kantner, and Haynes [2], Pollack [7], [8], Clarke, Krikorian, and Rausan [3], Sakarovitch [9] and others. This paper first reviews the algorithms presently available for finding the K shortest loopless paths in terms of the computational effort and memory addresses they require. This is followed by the presentation of the new algorithm and its justification. Finally, the efficiency of the new algorithm is examined and compared with that of other algorithms.},
